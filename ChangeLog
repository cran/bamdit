BAMDIT ChangeLog

Version 3.2.0 -- August 2018.

  * Corrections in the documentation.
  * Link the package to the JSS paper.
  * Function plotdata(), the argument max.size is active.

Version 3.1.0 -- May 2017

  * In metadiag() and plotdata() we allow that the data format is given
    as 2x2 table with columns' names: TP, FP, TN, FN.
  * A bug is fixed in the calcuation of the posterior distribution of BAUC.
  * The BSROC is calculated for parametrization: re.model = "SeSp".
  * New Summary function for metadiag.
  * New Print function for metadiag.

Version 3.0.0 -- August 2016

  * Implementation of S3 OOP in bamdit.
  * metadiag is now a generic function.
  * The argument re.model in metadiag allows to specify random effects on sensitivities
  and specificities.
  * Priors: hyper parameters mu.S and mu.D based on logistic distributions with mean = 0 and scale = 1
  * Priors for the degrees of freedom parameter: df truncated exponential.
  * The function metadiag calculates the posterior probabilities of outliers.
  * New functions: print; summary and plot for metadiag objects.
  * The new plot function summarizes data and model predictions.
  * The BSROC is only displayed in the range of the observed fpr. If this range is less than 20% the
    function gives a warning.
  * We added further documentation and new examples.
  * Further documentation.
  * More validation in input arguments.


Version 2.0.1 -- June 2015
  * minor typos fixed

Version 2.0 -- June 2015
  * The function bsroc() implements te Bayesian SROC curve
  * Bayesian Predictive surface added (BPS)
  * Calculation of the Bayesian area under the curve (BAUC)
  * Migration of all graphical functions, they use ggplot
  * The package "coda" is not required

Version 1.9 -- 2014
  * The function metadiag() has a new implementation with blueprint() function within metadiag()
  * option of using rjags or R2jags in metadiag()
  * conflict of evidence analysis in metadiag() by splitting the variable w in w1 and w2
  * Added a function for simulation of data (sim.meta)

Version 1.4 -- 2014-07-08
  * Improvement in the documentation

Version 1.3 -- 2013-03-15
  * New version of the function metadiag(). This version has main changes:
  * 1) The number of degrees of freedom in the model are fixed to a default value
  * 2) The Wishart prior distribution of the variance covariance matrix is replaced
  * by a conditional model where the priors are given to individual components.
  * 3) The priors of the variance covariance distribution are design to avoid boundary
  * problems in the parameter space.
  * The three adaptation trials are omited in metadiag()

Version 1.2	-- 2012-07-31
  * Added more graphical functions
  * We added meta-analysis examples data.
  * Improved internal model functions

Version 1.1-1 	-- 2011-12-08
  *  Examples do not run during testing.

Version 1.1 	-- 2011-08-30
  * Weights are return from the bamdit function
    when random effects are scale mixed.
  * Change warning messages when model fails to adapt in JAGS.

Version 1.0-1 	-- 2011-08-09
	* Nothing has to be written to disk anymore.
	* Models are compiled / adapted now with "first of three"
	  due to an issue where sometimes models don't adapt.
	* Added ChangeLog
	* Corrected model adaption process from three to two stages

Version 1.0		-- 2011-08-07
	* Initial release
